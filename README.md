# Welcome to my GitHub
I'm a graduated researcher from Stuttgart and have worked on topological materials on which I did optical studies in large magnetic fields. Below, you will find descriptions for some of my codes I decided to share.

## Free-Carrier Magneto Optics
The free-carrier contribution in magnetic fields experiences a plasma edge splitting. To visualize the reflectivity response, which is often not intuitive, I wrote my first Python GUI. Excuse the _alternative_ look. Younger me thought it would be very insightful to implement the program with Tkinter. 

## DPG-Presentation 2023
I started experimenting with Web languages for the DPG conference 2023 in Dresden. The presentation was written using RevealJS and is hosted at:

## PhD-Presentation
For my PhD-Presentation (2024) I wrote my own Javascript utilities. The presentation is hosted at:
