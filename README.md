# Welcome to my GitHub
I'm a graduated researcher from Stuttgart and have worked on topological materials on which I did optical studies in large magnetic fields. Below, you will find descriptions for some of my codes I decided to share.

## Free-Carrier Magneto Optics
The free-carrier contribution in magnetic fields experiences a plasma edge splitting. To visualize this response, which is often not intuitive, I wrote my first Python GUI. The program looks ... alternative, because younger me thought it would be very insightful to implement the program with Tkinter. Nevertheless, the program works like a charm and was consulted often.
